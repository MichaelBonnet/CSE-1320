the folder 'hw01' contains all files having to do with Homework Assignment 1,
  an assignment to find the mean, median, min, max, and sum of 5 entered integers.

the folder 'hw02' contains all files having to do with Homework Assignment 2,
  an assignment to create a Taylor Series of sinx (in radians of course) to the 4th term of the series
  and store x (degrees) on the integer interval [0, 359] into a lookup table of size 360.
  The user inputs an angle in degrees, and the program prints the user input, the linear interpolation
  between the two integer values of x closest to the user input, the result of calling the math.h function sin()
  on user input converted to radians, and the difference between the previous two terms.

the folder 'hw03' contains all files having to do with Homework Assignment 3,
  an assignment to help better understand bit operations by taking a user input integer,
  treat the integer as if it represents the binary of a packed BCD integer,
  use bit operations to unpack the "packed BCD integer",
  and print the constituent represented digits in a modified calculator format.
