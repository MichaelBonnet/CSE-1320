the file 'calculator_view_implementation.c' is simply a snippet of the main .c file that contains only the functions
  used to create the modified calculator view required by the assignment.
  
the file 'hw03_bonnet_michael.c' is the main .c file for the assignment and the single file I turned in.

the file 'hw03_bonnet_michael_kr_format.c' is a copy of the main .c file but is modified to (mostly) follow the K&R format,
  if only to show the "true" line count, as the program is meant to be around 100 lines with comments and asserts.
  
the file 'hw03_planning.txt' is a text file detailing my initial outline/plan for the assignment.

the file 'hw03_test_data.dat' is a data file that I used to give input to hw03_bonnet_michael.c via bash input redirection.

the file 'hw03_test_data_output.txt" is a text file that shows the output of hw03_test_data.dat plugged into hw03_bonnet_michael.c.

the file 'readme.txt' is this file.
