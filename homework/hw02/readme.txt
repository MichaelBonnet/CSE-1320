The purpose of this readme file is to explain the nature/purpose of each file in this folder of the CSE-1320 repository.

abstract.txt explains the assignment's goals in terms of what was to be achieved and what was to be learned,
along with some implementation/good practice comments and thanks.

readme.txt is this file, the table of contents for files in this folder.

hw02_bonnet_michael.c is the file I turned in as my assignment. 

hw02_bonnet_michael_version_current.c is the current version of this project as I optimize it/make it more readable.
    Note: I have not yet made this file.

hw02_bonnet_michael_no_asserts_or_comments.c is the version of the previous file without asserts or comments - just the pure logic and
arithmetic. Basically me showing off/motivating myself to make it more succint.
